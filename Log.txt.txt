Day 0: 6 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Solved the Blood Donors Problem on DrivenData (0.45 loss, rank 839).

Thoughts: I should focus on doing data analysis, and review visualisations of data. Improvement in performance is huge.


Day 1: 7 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Columbia University's EdX Course on Machine Learning to gain an understanding into decision trees and other basic ML algorithmms. Will hopefully be done by tomorrow. Explored Kaggle's Titanic Dataset, tried an LSTM-Neural Net hybrid architecture.

Thoughts: An understanding of basic ML algorithms will enable a better grip on each's use cases.

Day 2: 8 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Mining Massive Datasets course from Stanford(upto Lecture 8).

Thoughts: MapReduce and PageRank are interesting.


Day 3: 9 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started a course on Udemy on PyTorch. Completed understanding of the PageRank algorithm, SVD algorithm.
