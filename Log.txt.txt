Day 0: 6 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Solved the Blood Donors Problem on DrivenData (0.45 loss, rank 839).

Thoughts: I should focus on doing data analysis, and review visualisations of data. Improvement in performance is huge.


Day 1: 7 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Columbia University's EdX Course on Machine Learning to gain an understanding into decision trees and other basic ML algorithmms. Will hopefully be done by tomorrow. Explored Kaggle's Titanic Dataset, tried an LSTM-Neural Net hybrid architecture.

Thoughts: An understanding of basic ML algorithms will enable a better grip on each's use cases.

Day 2: 8 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started Mining Massive Datasets course from Stanford(upto Lecture 8).

Thoughts: MapReduce and PageRank are interesting.


Day 3: 9 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started a course on Udemy on PyTorch. Completed understanding of the PageRank algorithm, SVD algorithm.


Day 4: 10 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started learning PyTorch from Deep Learning Wizard's Course on Udemy.


Day 5: 11 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Finished the course on PyTorch.


Day 6: 12 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Checked out Capsule Networks, and watched a talk by Geoffery Hinton on them.

Day 7: 13 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Started the fast.ai course, watched the first 2 lectures of Part 1.

Thoughts: Learning Rate Annealing, LR Finder, Differential LR, Usinng Precomputed actiavtions are amazingly simple yet effective ideas. The fastai library seems to be really nice to use, looking forward to learning more about it!

Day 8: 14 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Lecture 3 of DL Part 1 Fast.AI and Lecture 1 of ML Fast.AI

Day 9: 15 July, 2018

Today's Progress: Lecture 2 of ML Fast.AI, learnt and used Random Forests.

Day 10: 16 July, 2018

Today's Progress:
